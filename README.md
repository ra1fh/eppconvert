# eppconvert

Tools to parse and convert Daum Ergo Bike EPP files.

Currently there is only eppread, which reads all epp versions from 1 to 7 and
dumps the data.  This tool contains a mostly complete specification of the file
format, using python-convert.

To run eppread, python-2.7 or python-3.4 with python-convert is required.
